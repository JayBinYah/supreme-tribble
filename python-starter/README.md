# Python Starter Project

This folder contains beginner-friendly Python examples aligned with CS50 basics.

## 📁 Files

- **hello.py** - Your first Python program with basic I/O
- **functions.py** - Working with functions, parameters, and return values
- **data_structures.py** - Lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets
- **requirements.txt** - Python dependencies (currently minimal)

## 🚀 Running the Programs

### From the Terminal

```bash
# Run hello.py
python3 hello.py

# Run functions.py
python3 functions.py

# Run data_structures.py
python3 data_structures.py
```

### Using VS Code

1. **Open a Python file**
2. **Click the "Run" button** (▶️) in the top-right corner, OR
3. **Right-click in the editor** and select "Run Python File in Terminal", OR
4. **Press F5** to run with debugging

## 🐛 Debugging

To debug any of these programs:

1. **Set a breakpoint** by clicking in the left margin (gutter) next to a line number
2. **Press F5** or go to Run → Start Debugging
3. **Use the debug controls** to step through your code:
   - Step Over (F10) - Execute the current line
   - Step Into (F11) - Go into function calls
   - Step Out (Shift+F11) - Return from current function
   - Continue (F5) - Run until next breakpoint

## 💡 Learning Exercises

Try these modifications to practice:

### hello.py
- [ ] Add a function to ask for the user's age and calculate birth year
- [ ] Use a while loop to keep asking for names until user types "quit"
- [ ] Add error handling for empty input

### functions.py
- [ ] Create a function to find the maximum number in a list
- [ ] Add a function to check if a number is prime
- [ ] Implement a function that reverses a string

### data_structures.py
- [ ] Create a dictionary to store a gradebook (students and their scores)
- [ ] Write a function to find common elements between two lists
- [ ] Implement a simple todo list using a list of dictionaries

## 🎯 Next Steps

After mastering these basics:
1. Explore more complex data structures
2. Learn about classes and object-oriented programming
3. Try working with files and APIs
4. Build a small project (calculator, todo app, etc.)
